'allcGuesses' = Labeled behavior (1:10) which has now been resampled and smoothed (but originally was not)

'ACGfrom100to10'= Convert 100 behaviors of ACG to the 10 from sH1

'tensOnly' = Extract only the 10s produced by "ACGfrom100to10" 1:10 list

'keepersOnly' = Bouts of 10 (locomotion) using a threshold of 10 frames

'corrected' = The bridge between 'allcGuesses' (behavioral classification ints) and the 18x2x95,998 LEAP labels ('pred_by_day

'CorrectedTens' = Go through each cell in 'corrected' and only keep the frames that we have determined are within a bout of 10 (locomotion).

Calculated Features:
  - Stance width 
  - distance between front left paw and back left paw to describe the gait difference when left paws move in unison (ASD) and when diagonal paws move in unison (wildtype)
  - velocity metrics (average mouse speed during locomotion,
  - stride length (mm)
  - cadence (strides/s)
  - swing velocity (m/s)
  - stance duration (ms)
  - mouse's walking speed (m/s)

        
  - Conditions: 
        * b/t forepaws
        * b/t rear paws
        * (before, during, after) an interaction?
        * still vs slow locomotion vs fast locomotion
