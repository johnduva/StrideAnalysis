The main (parent) script within this package ("StrideDetection_OG.m") was originally written by Dana Darmohray, Ana Machado, and Dennis Eckmeier within the Carey lab at Champalimaud Foundation. The children scripts "StrideDetection_PlotOnTracks.m", "StrideDetection_X.m", and "StrideDetection_NewDataPoints.m" have been drastically altered by John D'Uva to handle the Wang Lab's sLEAP tracking data. 

The contents of the original scripts can be found here: https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse_AnalysisTools

The goal of this repo is to allow the Wang Lab to continue utilizing the included scripts and to allow sLEAP analysis to be accessible to the entire lab.

All of these changes were written by John D'Uva (jduva4@jhu.edu) in Q2 of 2020.
