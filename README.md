This repo is a collection of analysis scripts that intake LEAP coordinate locations and output (1) a number of organized data structures, (2) figures for comparing stride features, and (3) mvoies for comparing diagonal paw synchrony.

The 'John Analysis' directory is comprised of:
 - .mat files == filtered data structs from 
 - .m files == data preprocessing
 - .png files == figures
 - .avi files == mouse videos (four paws only)



"StrideDetection_OG.m" and child script "StrideDetection_PlotOnTracks.m" were originally written by the Carey lab at Champalimaud Foundation. 
They have been significantly altered to handle the Wang Lab's LEAP tracking data, while the other children scripts were removed since they were not applicable. 
All of these changes were written by John D'Uva (jduva4@jhu.edu) in Q2/Q3 of 2020.
