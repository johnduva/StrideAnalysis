The guts of this package were originally written by Dana Darmohray and Ana Machado within the Carey lab at Champalimaud Foundation. 
It's contents can be found here: https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse_AnalysisTools

This iteration of the code has some changes:
  - improved notation/explanation
  - inclusion of helper scripts that allow sLEAP output to me massaged into readable format
  - (will update these as time goes on)

The goal is to allow the Wang Lab to utilize these scripts with their behavioral data. 
All of these changes were written by John D'Uva in Q1 and Q2 of 2020.
