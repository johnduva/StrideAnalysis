This repo is a collection of analysis scripts that intake LEAP coordinate locations and output gait analysis figures.

"StrideDetection_OG.m" and child script "StrideDetection_PlotOnTracks.m" were originally written by the Carey lab at Champalimaud Foundation. 
They have been significantly altered to handle the Wang Lab's LEAP tracking data, while the other children scripts were removed since they were not applicable. 
All of these changes were written by John D'Uva (jduva4@jhu.edu) in Q2 of 2020.
