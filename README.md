The parent script within this package ("StrideDetection_OG.m") and the child script ("StrideDetection_PlotOnTracks.m") were originally written by the Carey lab at Champalimaud Foundation. They have been significantly altered by John D'Uva to handle the Wang Lab's sLEAP tracking data (the other children scripts were removed since they were not applicable). John also added further gait analysis scripts including "avg_dist.m", "avgStrideLength.m", and "swingVsStanceSecs.m."

The contents of the original scripts can be found here: https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse_AnalysisTools

The goal of this repo is to allow the Wang Lab to continue utilizing the included scripts and to allow sLEAP analysis to be accessible to the entire lab.

All of these changes were written by John D'Uva (jduva4@jhu.edu) in Q2 of 2020.
